# 🧠 CodeAlpha Internship Task: Object Detection & Tracking

This project was completed as part of my internship at **CodeAlpha**. It demonstrates **real-time object detection and tracking** using the **YOLOv8 model** and the **SORT algorithm** with OpenCV and Python.

---

## 🎯 Objective

The goal of this project is to detect multiple objects in real-time from a video or webcam feed, assign consistent tracking IDs to them using the SORT tracker, and display the class labels (e.g., person, car, cat) on the video frames.
